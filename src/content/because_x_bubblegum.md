🎤 Your Story for Recruiters: Scaling a Startup to Acquisition and Pivoting to AI
"My core experience is rooted in building and scaling high-impact SaaS products. I spent over 3 years as a Founding Engineer at Because, a leading website personalization and A/B testing platform in the Shopify ecosystem.

The Because Success Story
"I joined Because early on, right as the e-commerce boom hit during COVID. I was instrumental in building the platform from the ground up, scaling it to over 800 customers, including major brands like Tom Brady, Hello Kitty, and Beyond Yoga. My work was full-stack, focusing heavily on performance optimization (e.g., reducing frontend load times by 35% and query times by 60%) and building robust data infrastructure using Go and ClickHouse.

"The ultimate success of this work was realized when I was instrumental in helping to get the company acquired by a top competitor in the space. This acquisition was a major validation of the team and the technology we built. Currently, my focus is on a final set of obligations related to the M&A process, including customer migration and ensuring their support through the critical Black Friday/Cyber Monday holiday season. I will be fully wrapped up with Because and ready for my next opportunity by mid-December."

The Bubblegum Chapter: Rapid AI Prototyping
"While the M&A process was underway, the founding team—the same team I've worked with for years—decided to leverage our deep domain knowledge and focus on the emerging AI space. This led to the creation of Bubblegum, which was an answer engine optimization and AI search platform to help brands get discovered inside of ChatGPT and other LLMs.

"We worked on this as an intense side project outside of our core responsibilities. Within a matter of weeks, we were able to launch the product, secure initial investor checks, and reach thousands of dollars in monthly recurring revenue (MRR). It was a fantastic demonstration of rapid full-stack development and market validation. Ultimately, the founder decided not to continue because the space was becoming too crowded and the underlying LLM technology (like the OpenAI APIs) was changing too frequently, making the foundation too volatile to build a long-term business on top of.

Bringing it Together
"This experience highlights my unique value: I can build and scale a complex B2B SaaS platform to a successful acquisition, and I have proven my ability to quickly prototype, launch, and monetize cutting-edge AI-powered products. I am now looking for a challenging full-stack role where I can combine my history of delivering performance and scale with my passion for leveraging AI to drive innovation."

Key Strengths of this Story:
Puts Acquisition First: The success and acquisition of Because is the "shining story" and is framed as a major career milestone.

Contextualizes Bubblegum: It clearly defines Bubblegum as a high-speed side project with the same proven team, making it a strength (ability to execute quickly) rather than a liability (a failed venture).

Provides a Clear Exit: It gives a firm end date (mid-December), signaling to the recruiter that you are ready and available soon.

Shows Technical Range: It moves you from a proven expert in Shopify/E-commerce/Go/ClickHouse to a demonstrated expert in LLM Integration/Rapid Prototyping/Modern Stack (Hono/React 19).

⏱️ 60-Second Summary: Acquisition Success and AI Prototyping
"I'm a Full-Stack Engineer who played a critical role in scaling Because, a website personalization and A/B testing platform in the Shopify space, from a startup to a successful acquisition.

I spent over three years as a Founding Engineer, helping scale the company to over 800 customers including major brands. My technical focus was on full-stack ownership, driving performance improvements—like reducing query times by 60% and front-end load by 35%—and building the data infrastructure that delivered results. I was instrumental in getting the company acquired by a top competitor. I'm wrapping up the final M&A obligations, including customer migration through Black Friday, and will be fully available in mid-December.

During the M&A process, I quickly co-founded Bubblegum with the same team as a side project, focused on AI Search Optimization using Gemini and GPT-4. We demonstrated rapid execution by launching, reaching thousands in MRR, and securing initial investment checks within weeks. While we decided the LLM space was too volatile for a long-term business, this chapter proves my ability to rapidly prototype, monetize, and build cutting-edge AI products.

I'm now looking for a challenging role where I can combine my history of delivering scale, performance, and acquisition success with my expertise in modern AI integration."
